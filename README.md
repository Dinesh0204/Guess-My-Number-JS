# Game Features
The game generates a random number between 1 and 20.

The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

The player's score is displayed, starting from 20 and decreasing with each incorrect guess.

The game keeps track of the high score, which represents the highest score achieved by a player.
